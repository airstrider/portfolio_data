# Supervised Classification modeling

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict whether a future traveler would be satisfied with their services given traveler feedback given previous traveler feedback about their flight experience.

To meet the goal, the project will build three different types of machine learning models that make predictions for a target based on multiple features.

For the project, `Galactico Airline.csv`, the survey data from 129,880 customers of a virtual airline, will be used.
It includes data points such as `class`, `flight distance`, and `in-flight entertainment`, among others. 

With the data, the project will construct and evaluate three models that can accomplish the project goal. Specifically, the project will be interested in knowing which features are most important to customer satisfaction.

The project consists of 5 parts.
* Part 1: Exploring the data and completing the cleaning process.
* Part 2: Building a `Decision Tree` model.
* Part 3: Building a `Random Rorrest` model.
* Part 4: Building a `XGBoost` model.
* Part 5: Evaluating the models.

Each part has its own introduction.
